console.log("HELLO WORLD");
console.log("Second");

//variables
//var let const
//var is fuction scoped

//properties of var are: redeclaration,reassignment,global scope,functional scope
// when we use var and use that variable anywhere it shows a strike on it


//let
//It properties are no-redeclaration,reassignment
// It scopes are global scope, functional scope and block scope

//const
//it properties are only declararion not allowed,no reassignment,it also has same scope as let


//hoisting
//console.log(a);
//var a=10; or let a=10;

//Js first reads the file then compile it so when it reads console.log(a) it craetes a var a so in cas of var it not shows error and in let  or const it shows error as let and const doesnt allow redeclaration
